## Get Going

This project is set up as an example using the following rules:

```
{
  "*.js": [
    "eslint --fix",
    "git add",
    "jest --bail --findRelatedTests"
  ],
  "*.py": [
    "black"
  ],
  "*.{json,md,yaml,yml}": [
    "prettier --write",
    "git add"
  ]
}
```

If you have successfully installed the project you should be able to change or add any files matching the rules and see them pass or fail against the rule set.
